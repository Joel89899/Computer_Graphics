## 1. PUSH BUTTON
Pedestrian push buttons are buttons or detectors placed on the traffic lights 
which enable the pedestrians to get access to the road when activated. 
On activation the pedestrian traffic light turns green and the driverâ€™s traffic 
light turn red enabling the pedestrian to cross the road

## Advantages of pedestrian push button
* Reduce pedestrian accidents as vehicles can be stopped for pedestrians to cross safely.
* Saves time for pedestrian since they can access the road immediately.
* Generally, increases pedestrian safety as pedestrian is the most vulnerable user of the road

## IMPLEMENTATION
OpenGl was used to implement the use of the pedestrian push button by 
programming with C++ language in the Visual Studio

The primitive functions included in the project are:
1. GL_POLYGON: For Drawing Polygons
2. GL_QUADS: For Drawing quadrilaterals
3. GL_LINE_STRIP: For drawing strips of lines.
4. GLUT_SINGLE: For frame buffer
5. GLUT_RGB: For Color index selection
6. glutKeyboardFunc(keyDown): Keyboard call-back function
